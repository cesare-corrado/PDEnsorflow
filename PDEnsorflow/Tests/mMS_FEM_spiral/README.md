# Tests/mMS_FEM_spiral

## Description
This example implements the monodomain with the modified Mitchell Shaeffer model on a 2D square domain using finite elements.
The domain has 1M nodes and the simulation triggers a spiral wave using a cross-field protocol.
It applies two sources (external stimuli) contained in a dict of stimulus objects.
The output is in *.igb* format.
