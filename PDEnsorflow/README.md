# PDEnsorflow sources

This sub-folder collects the sources of **PDEnsorflow**:



* `data`: input data for the examples
* `gpuSolve`: the gpuSolve library
* `Tests` some examples to test the library. 

The file `init.sh` comes from the previous version and was used 
to configure the library paths (`source init.sh`). 
The new version under pipi no longer needs this file.
